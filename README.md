# Spotify-end-to-end-data-engineering-project
In this project, we aim to create an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline by leveraging the Spotify API on the AWS cloud platform. The pipeline's primary purpose is to retrieve data from the Spotify API concerning the top 50 global songs, transform this data into a desired format, and subsequently store it in an AWS data repository.
