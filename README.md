# Spotify End-To-End Data Engineering Project

### Introduction 
In this project, we aim to create an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using Spotify API on the AWS cloud platform. The pipeline's primary purpose is to retrieve data from the Spotify API, transform this data into a desired format, and Load it into an AWS data repository.
